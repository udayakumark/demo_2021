                    <p>Rice Whole Rice Is Low In Calories And Fat, Sodium-Free, And Rich In Complex Carbohydrates, Vitamins, Minerals, And Fiber. Itâ€™s No Wonder That Rice Is A Staple Food For A Large Segment Of The Worldâ€™s Population. Although Rice Is Lower In Protein Than Other Cereal Grains, Its Protein Quality Is Good Because It Contains Relatively High Levels Of The Essential Amino Acid Lysine.
When White Rice Is Refined, It Is Milled And Polished, A Process That Removes The Bran And Germ As Well As Many Valuable Nutrients. In The US, However, Most White Rice Is Enriched With Thiamin, Niacin, Folate, And Iron, As Well As Fiber And Selenium.
Brown Rice, Which Has Only The Outer Hull Removed, Retainsâ€”Along With Its Bran Layerâ€”Thiamin, Niacin, And Vitamin B6. And Because The Bran Is Not Milled Away, Brown Rice Is A Better Source Of Fiber Than White Rice. Brown Rice Supplies 3.5 Grams Of Fiber Per 1-Cup Servingâ€”Five Times More Fiber Than You Get From White Rice.</p>
